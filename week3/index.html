        <h1>WEEK 3 NOTES</h1>

        <h2>Object Methods, "this"</h2>
        <p>- Functions that are stored in object properties are called "methods"</p>
        <p>- Methods allow objects to "act" like [ object.doSomething() ]</p>
        <p>- Methods can reference the object as [ this ]</p>
        <p>- -- The value of [ this ] is defined at RUN-TIME.</p>
        <p>- When a function is declared, it may use [ this ], but that [ this ] has no value UNTIL the function is
            called.</p>
        <p>- A function can be copied between objects.</p>
        <p>- When a function is called in the "method" syntax: [ object.method() ], the value of [ this ] during the
            call is [ object ].</p>

        <h2> Ch5: Objects</h2>
        <p>Everything in JS is either one of the six primitive data types or an object.</p>
        <ul>Topics Covered in this chapter
            <li>Object Literals</li>
            <ul>
                <li>An object literal is an object that created directly in the language by wrapping all it's properties
                    and methods in " { } "</li>
                <li>Each property is a key-value pair, SEPARATED by commas.</li>
                <li>(EXAMPLE: const superman = { name: 'Cody' , hero: true, villain: false, allies: ['Batman',
                    'Supergirl'] };</li>
                <li>All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. Properties and methods can be changes
                    or removed - or created even if it was declared using "const"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adding properties to objects</li>
            <li>Object methods</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>The [ MATH ] object</li>
            <li>The [ DATE ] object</li>
            <li>The [ RegExp ] object</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2> Ch6: Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>The DOM allows you to access elements of a webpage and enable interacion with the page by adding and removing elements, etc. </p>
        <ul>Topics Covered in this chapter
            <li>Intro to the DOM</li>
            <li>Getting Elements</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"getElementByid()"</li>
                    <li>"createElement()"</li>
                    <li>"appendChild()"</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Navigating the DOM</li>
            <li>Getting and setting an element's attributes</li>
            <li>Updating the DOM by creating dynamic markup</li>
            <li>Changing the CSS of an element</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2> Ch7: Events</h2>
        <p>Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the webpage and the user interactions...everytime a user interacts with a web page such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.</p>
        <ul>Topics Covered in this chapter
            <li>Intro to events</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>"addEventListener" --- [ document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); ]</li>
                   <li>The [ click ] event occurs when a user clicks with the mouse, presses the Enter key, or taps on the screen, making it a very useful all-round event covering many types of interaction</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Adding event listeners</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The recommended way of dealing with events, and the current standard, is to use event listeners. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>The event object</li>
            <li>Mouse, keyboard, and touch events</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several types of events you can see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">full list of the Events page here</a>  </li>
                    <li>Mouse Events ---- "click" | "mousedown" | "mouseup" | "mouseover" | "mouseover" | "mousemove"  </li>
                    <li>This list is pretty big with mouse, keyboard and even touch....just look at the link</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Removing event listeners</li>
            <li>Stopping default behavior</li>
            <li>Event propagation</li>
        </ul>
