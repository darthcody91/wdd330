      <h3>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
      <p>For years, the only way to display text on an angle was to use an image of text created in an image-editing program and the only way to animate was to change positioning with JavaScript.</p>
      <ul>
        Transforms
        <li>The [transform] porperty lets you translate, rotate, scale and skew any element in the page. --- there's much more control over many aspects of an element's appearance.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>Transform Functions:
        <uL>
        <li>Translation - allows you to move elements left, right, up, down.</li>
        <li>The [translate(x,y)] function moves an element "x" from the left and "y" from the top</li>
        <li>If you want to just want to move an element vertically or horizontally, use the [translatex or translatey] functions </li>
        </uL>
        <ul>
        <li>Scaling - scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically - if only one value is provided it will be used for both.</li>
        <li>[scale(1)] would leave the element the same size, [scale(2)] would double its proportions, [scale(0.5)] would halve them, and so on.</li>
        <li>Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Rotation - rotates. generally declared in degrees. Positive moving clockwise, Negative moving counterclockwise</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>Transitions
        <p>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.</p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
        <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
        <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take</li>
              </ul>
