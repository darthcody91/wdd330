            The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two
            parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will
            request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which
            processes the request and sends back a response to the client.

            JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting
            language, meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding dynamic
            features to the web page that was returned from the server. Ajax
            allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of
            the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small
            fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.
