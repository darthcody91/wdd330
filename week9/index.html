      <h3>Ch9: The Window Object</h3>
      <p>
        Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are
        created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and
        any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global
        object is the window object, which represents the browser window that
        contains a web page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        The Browser Object Model (BOM)
        <li>
          A collection of properties and methods that contain information about
          the browser and computer screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember that JS can be run in DIFFERENT environments. The BOM only
          makes sense in a browser environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other environments like "Node.js" won't have a "window" object ---
          they will have a "global" object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Going Global
        <li>
          Global variables can be created without using the [const, let, var]
          keywords. - in a browser, the global object is the "window"
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, you should refer to global variables with using the
          "window" --- it's less typing, and the code will be more portable
          between environments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Dialogs
        <li>
          Three functions that produce dialogs in browsers --- ALERT() |
          CONFIRM() | PROMPT()
        </li>
        <li>
          The "window.alert()" will pause the execution of the program and
          display a message in a dialog box.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "window.confim()" will stop the execution of the program and
          display a confirmation dialog that shows the message, and giving the
          options of OK or Cancel. (It returns the boolean values of "true" if
          the user clicks OK and "false" if the user clicks CANCEL
        </li>
        <li>
          The "window.prompt()" will stop the execution of the program. Displays
          a message provided, as well as an input field that allows the user to
          enter text. -- this text is then returned as string when the user
          clicks OK, if the user clicks cancel, "null" is returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s worth reiterating again that these methods will stop the
          execution of a program in its tracks. This means that everything will
          stop processing at the point the method is called, until the user
          clicks OK or Cancel. This can cause problems if the program needs to
          process something else at the same time or the program is waiting for
          a callback function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Controlling Windows
        <li>
          These methods were largely responsible for giving JavaScript a bad
          name, as they were used for creating annoying pop-up windows that
          usually contained intrusive advertisements. It’s also a bad idea from
          a usability standpoint to resize or move a user’s window.
        </li>
        <li>A new window can be opened using the "window.open()" method.</li>
        <li>
          [ const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','
          SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes'); ]
        </li>
        <li>The "close()" method can be used to close a window</li>
        <li>
          It is also possible to move and resize the window ---
          [window.moveTo(0,0) | window.resizeTo(600,400) ]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Other things to note:
        <li>
          The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document
          and should be avoided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between
          requests using the document.cookie property.
        </li>
        <li>
          The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after
          a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout()
          method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a
          function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce
          smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in
          graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the
          cancelAnimationFrame() method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ch14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
      <p>
        HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the specification. It also went beyond the actual markup language and brought together a number of related technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <ul>
       HTML5
        <li>
            The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed. It also means that when a previously unforeseen development occurs, a new module can be created to cater for it. Modules can be at different stages of maturity, from ideas to full implementation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          The [data- ] Attribute
          <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          HTML5 APIs
          <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>
        <li>There are some security and privacy considerations to keep in mind when considering some HTML5 APIs – especially those on the cutting edge that haven't been used 'in the wild' for long.</li>
        </ul>
    <ul>Other things covered in this chapter
        <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>
        <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>
        <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
        <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>
        <li>The "audio" and "video" elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Managing the modern Front-end workflow</h2>
<ul> Developers have produced tools to help managae work-flow
    <li>Package Managers: These keep track of all of the external dependencies for our app. Both development tools and libraries we might be using. It knows not only which packages to download...but tracks versions as well. We are using npm for our package manager.</li>
    <li>Bundlers: bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating, minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using Parcel as our bundler. Another common bundler is Webpack</li>
    <li>Task managers: these keep track of what needs to be done and when. There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just using npm again for task manager. Other common managers are Grunt or Gulp</li>
