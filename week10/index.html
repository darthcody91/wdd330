    <h3>MDN: Validating forms</h3>
    <p>Client-side form validation</p>
    <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid
      data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a
      noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix
      their data.</p>
    <h3>What is form validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When you go to a site, fill out a form but don't do it the way they want, you will usually get a message: "You
        can't leave this blank" | "Please enter a valid email address"</li>
      <li>Form Validation: hen you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in
        the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called
        client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.</li>
      <li>We want filling out forms as easy as possible...however there are three reasons for validating forms:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We want to get the right data in the right format</li>
        <li>We want to protect our users' data</li>
        <li>We want to protect ourselves</li>
      </ul>
      <li>There are two different types of client-side validation that you encounter on the web...built-in form
        validation / javascript</li>
      <li>Validation Attributes on form elements</li>
      <ul>
        <li>required</li>
        <li>minlength & maxlength</li>
        <li>min & max</li>
        <li>type</li>
        <li>pattern</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Another useful validation feature is the "pattern" attribute, which expects a REGULAR EXPRESSION as its value.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).</li>
        <li>abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.</li>
        <li>ab?c—Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. ( ac or abc)</li>
        <li>ab*c—Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. ( ac , abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
        </li>
        <li>a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.</li>
        <li>abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).</li>
        <li>Example ---- "input id="choose" name="i_like" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry" </li>
      </ul>
      <li>validationMessage</li>
      <li>validity ----- ValidityState </li>
      <ul>
        <li>patternMismatch</li>
        <li>tooLong</li>
        <li>tooShort</li>
        <li>rangeOverflow</li>
        <li>rangeUnderflow</li>
        <li>typeMismatch</li>
        <li>valid</li>
        <li>valueMissing</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Summary:</li>
      <li>Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages,
        but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always remember to help your users correct the
        data they provide. To that end, be sure to:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Display explicit error messages</li>
        <li>Be permissive about the input format</li>
        <li>Point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms</li>
        <li> - once you have checked that the form is filled out correctly, it can be resubmitted</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>MDN: Fetch</h3>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uploading JSON data</li>
      <li>--- Use "fetch()" to POST JSON-encoded data</li>
      <li>Uploading a fiel</li>
      <li>--- Files can be uploaded using an HTML [input type="file"] input element, [FormData() and fetch()]</li>
    </ul>
