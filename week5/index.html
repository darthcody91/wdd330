        <h2>FORMS</h2>
        <p>- Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page.</p>
        <p>- Made up of the [ form ] element that contains input fields, select menus and buttons</p>
        <ul>Topics Covered in this chapter
            <li>Form Controls</li>
            <ul>
                <li> "document.forms"</li>
                <li> "searchInput"</li>
                <li>[input] fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads

                    [select] menus for drop-down lists of options
                    
                    [textarea] elements for longer text entry
                    
                    [button] elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
                
            </ul>
            <li>Accessing form elements</li>
            <ul>
                <li> "form.submit()"</li>
                <li> A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an input element with a type attribute of image:</li>
                <li> Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data thatâ€™s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form. </li>
